{"name":"Wec-Sim","tagline":"Wave Energy Converter SIMulator","body":"![](http://energy.sandia.gov/wp/wp-content/gallery/uploads/wec_sim_header.png)\r\n\r\nWEC-Sim (Wave Energy Converter Simulator) is an open-source wave energy converter (WEC) simulation tool. The code is developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK using the multi-body dynamics solver SimMechanics. WEC-Sim has the ability to model devices that are comprised of rigid bodies, power-take-off systems, and mooring systems. Simulations are performed in the time-domain by solving the governing WEC equations of motion in 6 degrees-of-freedom as described in the WEC-Sim Theory Manual. The WEC-Sim project is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Wind and Water Power Technologies Office and the code development effort is a collaboration between the [National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)]((www.nrel.gov/water)) and [Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)](http://energy.sandia.gov/?page_id=834).\r\n\r\n#Installing\r\nOnce the code is downloaded, unzip the source code folder and follow the installation guidelines presented in the WEC-Sim User Guide. The WEC-Sim development team has also developed a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgDbRY6Lvao) that demonstrates how to setup and run a simulation.\r\n\r\nUser Questionnaire**\r\nWe encourage all WEC-Sim users to complete the [WEC-Sim questionnaire](http://goo.gl/nFsWYu.info). Your feedback will be used to help direct future code development and improvement efforts.\r\n\r\n#Principal Developers\r\n* Yi-Hsiang Yu (NREL)\r\n* Michael Lawson (NREL)\r\n* Kelley Ruehl (SNL)\r\n* Carlos Michelen (SNL)\r\n* Nathan Tom (NREL)\r\n \r\n\r\n#Project Contributors\r\n* Adam Nelessen (Georgia Tech)\r\n* Sam Kanner (University of California at Berkeley)\r\n* Chris McComb (Carnegie Mellon University)\r\n\r\n#References\r\nY.
